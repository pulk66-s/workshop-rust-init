# Exercise 02: Variables & Data Types

## Learning Objectives
- Understand immutability vs mutability
- Learn about different data types (integers, floats, booleans, chars)
- Practice type annotations
- Understand shadowing

## Instructions

1. Open `src/main.rs`
2. Complete the TODO sections to:
   - Create and modify mutable variables
   - Work with different numeric types
   - Use boolean and character types
   - Practice variable shadowing

## Expected Behavior

The program should compile and run without errors, demonstrating:
- Mutable variable modification
- Type conversions
- Shadowing with different types

## Hints

- Use `mut` keyword for mutable variables
- Type annotations: `let x: i32 = 5;`
- Shadowing allows reusing variable names with different types
- Integer types: i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64
- Float types: f32, f64

## Running the Exercise

```bash
cd ex02
cargo run
```
