# Exercise 04: Control Flow

## Learning Objectives
- Use if/else statements and expressions
- Work with loops (loop, while, for)
- Use the match expression
- Understand break and continue

## Instructions

1. Open `src/main.rs`
2. Complete the TODO sections to practice:
   - if/else conditionals
   - Different types of loops
   - Match expressions
   - Loop control with break and continue

## Tasks

Implement the following:
- Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Use a loop to calculate factorial
- Use while loop to countdown
- Use for loop to iterate over a range
- Use match to classify numbers

## Hints

- `if` can be used as an expression
- `loop` creates an infinite loop (use `break` to exit)
- `while` loops while a condition is true
- `for` is great for iterating over ranges or collections
- `match` must be exhaustive (cover all cases)

## Running the Exercise

```bash
cd ex04
cargo run
```
