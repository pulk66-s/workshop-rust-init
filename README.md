# Rust Workshop for Beginners 🦀

Welcome to the Rust Workshop! This comprehensive workshop will teach you the fundamentals of Rust programming through hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/
- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- A code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or any text editor)

## Workshop Structure

This workshop contains 10 exercises, each focusing on a specific Rust concept:

1. **ex01** - Hello World & Basic Syntax
2. **ex02** - Variables & Data Types
3. **ex03** - Functions
4. **ex04** - Control Flow (if/else, loops, match)
5. **ex05** - Ownership & Borrowing
6. **ex06** - Structs
7. **ex07** - Enums & Pattern Matching
8. **ex08** - Error Handling
9. **ex09** - Collections (Vec, HashMap)
10. **ex10** - Traits

## How to Use This Workshop

1. **Read the cheatsheet**: Start by reviewing `CHEATSHEET.md` for a quick reference of Rust concepts
2. **Work through exercises in order**: Each exercise builds on previous concepts
3. **Read each exercise's README**: Each folder contains a `README.md` with instructions
4. **Write code**: Complete the exercises in the provided files
5. **Test your code**: Run `cargo run` in each exercise folder to test your solution
6. **Check solutions**: Each exercise includes a `solution.rs` file (try solving it yourself first!)

## Running Exercises

Navigate to an exercise folder and run:

```bash
cd ex01
cargo run
```

To check your code compiles:
```bash
cargo check
```

To run tests (if available):
```bash
cargo test
```

## Getting Help

- Check the `CHEATSHEET.md` for quick reference
- Read the Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
- Ask questions in the Rust community: https://users.rust-lang.org/

## Tips for Learning Rust

- **Take your time with ownership**: This is Rust's most unique feature and takes time to master
- **Read compiler errors**: Rust's compiler is incredibly helpful and will guide you
- **Practice regularly**: Work through exercises multiple times
- **Experiment**: Modify the code and see what happens
- **Don't get discouraged**: Rust has a learning curve, but it's worth it!

## What's Next?

After completing this workshop:
- Build small projects (CLI tools, web servers)
- Explore the Rust ecosystem (crates.io)
- Join the Rust community
- Read "The Rust Programming Language" book in detail

Happy coding! 🚀
